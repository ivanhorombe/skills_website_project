<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Ivan Baraka Horombe. I have a older brother,Ethan, and younger sister and brother, Helen and Allen. Ethan is 20, I'm 17, Helen's 14, and Allen is 8.
  My mom, Marina is 50, and so is my dad, Chacha. We live in Richmond, Texas. I play soccer for Foster Highschool. I've been playing soccer since I was 4. My other hobbies are playing
  board/card games with my family, video games(Roblox) with Allen, and watching videos about cool inventions. My whole family is from Tanzania and we're Catholic.</p>

<p>I'm into physics and engineering. I am probably going to study engineering and business at Texas A&M. After that, I want to start a company related to robots or transportation.
  I would also like to find a way to efficiently harness energy. My goal is to own a billion-dollar company. I hope to invent something that will change the world forever.
  I want to live somewhere that snows occasionally, maybe in the woods of Colorado when I have a family. When I'm by myself I'd want to live in a super-urban area, such as New York City.
  I'd have to have a summer beach house because I don't always want to be cold. I hope I can travel ther world and see all the historic cities like Paris, London, and Rome.</p>

<p>I would describe myself as thoughtful and hard-working. My favorite food is pepperoni pizza with lots of parmesan. My favorite drink is Blue Rasberry Fanta, but I haven't had it in years.
  I'm team Adidas and Xbox. My favorite video game was Destiny for years until Fortnite released in 5th grade. However, the most fun games to play with others is Mario Kart and Mario & Sonic Olympics.
  My dream car is a Mercedes of any type. Their logo looks so elegant. Rolls-Royce also looks beautiful. Obviously, soccer is my favorite sport, and Manchester City is my team but I don't watch.
  My most important values are gratefulness and fairness. I think too many people take forgranted the position their in, and so many people who deserve more have less.
  I also believe in making the most out of every second because life passes by so fast. The things I need to work on are confidence and discipline. Most important of all,
  live life for God.
